# paletteswapper

You need to download only paletteswapper.py

But you have to create a CSV file which includes color map

(From Color)R, G ,B , (To Color)R, G, B

And repeat...

You can execute the script by running
```python ./paletteswapper.py <CSV File> <From Folder includes Base Conveyers> <To Folder>
